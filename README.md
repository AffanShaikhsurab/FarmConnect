- **Financial Instability:** Over 200,000 farmers have committed suicide due to debt accumulation, often driven by unfair crop prices.
- **Lack of Market Access:** 60% of farmers cannot access fair markets, limiting their ability to negotiate better prices.
- **Illiteracy and Technology Barriers:** Nearly 30% of rural farmers are illiterate, making it difficult to use existing digital platforms.
- **Quality Assurance Gap:** Without a certification system, farmers struggle to prove the quality of their crops.
